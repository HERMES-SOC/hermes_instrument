Developer Environment
*********************

This Python package is used in the pipeline processing of scientific data from HERMES.
Special consideration is therefore required to ensure that development is compatible with the pipeline environment.
It is also important to ensure that this package is compatible with a user's systems such as a mac and windows.

See the parent package for the `documentation <https://hermes-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-guide/dev_env.html>`_.
